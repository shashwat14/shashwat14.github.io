## Hi, I'm Shashwat 👋

I'm an Applied Scientist at Amazon, working on generative AI, mostly LLMs and VLMs. Over the years, I've gotten my hands dirty across the full stack: pretraining, post-training, and optimization.

### Why This Blog?

Honestly, I think of myself as a dummy who's constantly learning new things. This blog is my way of capturing that process, writing things down as I figure them out, with all the details I wish I had when I started. I hope you find it useful too!
