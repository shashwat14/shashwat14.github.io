I am a master’s student at Columbia University specializing in Machine Learning. My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and computer vision. I have more than 3 year’s of experience in solving problems in self-driving cars, warehouse robotics, and computer vision. Right before starting my graduate course at Columbia, I was an Applied Scientist Intern at Amazon Robotics AI where I developed computer vision based algorithms for grasping. Prior to this, I worked as a software engineer at Singapore-MIT Alliance for Research and Technology – Future Urban Mobility (SMART-FM) where I developed perception technology for self-driving vehicles.

I am fortunate to have worked with some fantastic mentors and advisors over the past few years: Prof. Peter Allen (Columbia University), Dr. Sebastian Hoefer (Amazon Robotics AI), Prof. Daniela Rus (MIT), Dr. Eng You Hong (Nutonomy/Aptiv), and Prof. Marcelo Ang (NUS)
